If you find GitHub Actions or tools like Pylint too strict, there are a few adjustments and practices you can apply to make it easier to use without compromising much on code quality. Here are some simpler configurations and common adjustments for making the GitHub Actions workflow more lenient and manageable:

1. Disable Some Pylint Checks
If Pylint is too strict, you can disable certain checks that may be irrelevant or overly opinionated for your project. For example, you can allow missing docstrings or ignore unused imports.

To do this:

Create or Modify .pylintrc File: Pylint allows you to configure which checks to disable. You can generate a default configuration file with:

bash
Copy code
pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc
Modify the .pylintrc File to disable certain checks: Example: Disable warnings for missing docstrings and unused variables:

ini
Copy code
[MESSAGES CONTROL]
disable=C0114,C0115,C0116,W0613
This will disable module-level docstring (C0114), function/method docstrings (C0116), and unused argument warnings (W0613).

Alternatively, you can add these lines to the GitHub Actions workflow to use this .pylintrc file:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Run Pylint with custom configuration
  run: pylint --rcfile=.pylintrc $(git ls-files '*.py')
2. Skip Linting for Certain Files
If you want to avoid running Pylint on certain files (e.g., auto-generated files or temporary files), you can configure the pylint command to exclude them by specifying an exclude option in the .pylintrc file:

ini
Copy code
[MASTER]
# Exclude files like migrations or test output
ignore=tests/migrations,tests/output,*.md
Alternatively, you can modify the GitHub Actions workflow to only lint specific files:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Run Pylint on main files only
  run: pylint $(git ls-files '*.py' | grep -v 'tests/|migrations/')
3. Use a Laxer Linting Tool
If you feel Pylint is still too strict, consider switching to a more lenient linter like flake8, which tends to have fewer built-in checks. It provides a good balance between style enforcement and flexibility.

To use flake8:

Install Flake8 in your workflow:
yaml
Copy code
- name: Install flake8
  run: pip install flake8
Run Flake8:
yaml
Copy code
- name: Run flake8
  run: flake8 certificate_checker.py
Configure Flake8:
You can create a .flake8 file to specify which checks to enable or disable. For example:

ini
Copy code
[flake8]
max-line-length = 100
extend-ignore = E203, E402
max-line-length allows you to set a maximum line length, and extend-ignore lets you specify which warnings to ignore.

4. Set Workflow to Run on Pull Requests Only
If you want to run the linting checks less frequently (e.g., only when opening a pull request), you can adjust the GitHub Actions trigger to only run on pull requests:

yaml
Copy code
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
This way, linting will only run when code is proposed for merging into the main branch, reducing the number of checks on every commit.

5. Reduce the Frequency of Runs (Schedule Linting)
If you want to run linting less often (e.g., daily or weekly), you can schedule it:

yaml
Copy code
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # This runs the workflow every day at midnight
This is helpful if you want to periodically enforce quality checks but don’t need them on every commit.

6. Set Laxer Python Versions for Matrix Testing
If running Pylint or other tests on multiple Python versions is too cumbersome, you can narrow down the Python versions tested. For example, run tests only on the latest stable version:

yaml
Copy code
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ["3.10"]
This will limit the workflow to just one Python version rather than testing multiple versions.

Simplified Example Workflow
Here’s a relaxed version of the GitHub Actions workflow that:

Runs on pull requests.
Uses flake8 instead of pylint.
Only checks the main Python file (certificate_checker.py).
Ignores certain files and configures a more lenient linter.
yaml
Copy code
name: Lint Code with Flake8

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Python 3.10
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: 3.10

    - name: Install flake8
      run: pip install flake8

    - name: Run flake8 on certificate_checker.py
      run: flake8 certificate_checker.py
